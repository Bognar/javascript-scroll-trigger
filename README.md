Trendy fly in elements people use on websites. Usually some people build website with scripts like http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/ but to put that kind of code in website
and use it just for 2-3 elements is not a best practice. Therefore, I've made a simple code to do it and with a bit of change, any element can be made to fly in on designated position.
